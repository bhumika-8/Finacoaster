# Finacoaster


This project provides a platform for users to track their finances, engage in fun financial simulator games, and explore their earning and spending history. The website presents users with a dashboard where they can visualize their financial data and interact with two inbuilt financial games that help hone budgeting and credit management skills. Additionally, users can view their historical financial data, check the leaderboard, and stay informed through financial news fetched from a live API.
